# Opengl-Tutorial Examples

These tutorials are taken from opengl-tutorial.org

The first two tutorials are left in here for posterity, but do not include any examples of this package (mathgl). They are solely go-gl/gl and go-gl/glfw examples.

Tutorial 3 and up should have varying degrees of mathgl examples, generally replacing where glm was used in the tutorials.
